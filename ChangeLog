  distros consider that release "experimental".  worked around it
  with a simple: 
  
  no if $] >= 5.018, warnings => "experimental::smartmatch";

% re-wrote preserve directory function.  it actually works again...

+ added parallel processing.  about time we put those cores to use!

[9-24-2013]

  additons/changes I feel its warranted: For now 
  we're still in the nightly/pre-release testing stage

+ GNOME Support Added:
